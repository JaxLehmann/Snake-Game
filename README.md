# Snake-Game
This project is a classic Snake Game built in Java using Swing for the GUI. The code was originally based on Bro Code's YouTube tutorial and used as a learning tool to understand 2D game development, Java graphics, event handling, and game loops.

This project helped me explore how games manage state, player input, and screen rendering. While the core logic was based on a tutorial, I plan to experiment with additional features like score saving, speed control, and game skins to make it my own.
